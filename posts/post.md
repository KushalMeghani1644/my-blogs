Hi everyone! this is my first ever blog 👋

My name is **Kushal Meghani**, and I’m a passionate Rust developer and open-source enthusiast. I love building tools and apps that are not only practical but also fun to use.

One of my main projects is the **Rusty-Suite**, a collection of Rust-based tools including:

- **RustyTodos**: A CLI/TUI/GUI todo app built entirely in Rust.
- **RustyBoot**: A lightweight bootloader that works with ext partitions.
- **ls-rs**: A Rust clone of the classic `ls` command.
- **Rusty-Checker**: A tool to stress-test memory for RowHammer vulnerabilities.

You can check out the Rusty-Suite and all the projects here: [rusty-suite.tech](https://rusty-suite.tech)

All my projects are open-source and maintained on GitHub: [github.com/KushalMeghani1644](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644)

I’ll be using this blog to share updates, tutorials, and insights about Rust, system programming, and my journey in open-source development.

Stay tuned for more posts! 🚀
